<p>Here I would like to discuss my personal thief build and some tips and tricks I have picked up that help me be very successful at thieving and making lots of gold!</p>

<p>I have only been playing ESO for a few years at this point, but I have played Elder Scrolls games and Bethesda games since I was young! I love the casual, role-playing aspects and wealth of lore available in these games! ZOS has, in my opinion, done an excellent job at capturing and expanding the existing lore and creating an awesome Multi-player experience that is tailored to fit many different play styles.</p>

<p>First off- This is just a collection of my personal experience, and is intended as an in-depth guide but, please keep in mind your experience or preference may differ! <br />
This build focuses around being <b class="orange2">extremely fast</b> as well as eficently moving from target to target, while being able to evade guards or get away from them quickly.
</p>
        <hr>
<p>My Build is a Kajiit Nightblade Vampire, but honestly the most important aspect is the <b class="red2">Nightblade Class</b>, as the main mechanic I use for evading and escaping guards is the ability Shadowy Disguise (Morphed from Shadow Cloak). 
<br />
This ability, paired with specific <i class="gold2">Invisibility Potions</i> is key to escaping when you are caught by guards.</p>

<p>Okay, so far we have, preferably, a Kajiit Nightblade, Shadowy Disguise on our bar and a huge stack of Invis. Pots, the other important features of this build are <b style="color:deepskyblue;">Champion Points</b> and <b class="violet">Good Gear</b>. These are the second most important parts of this build, that are actually integral to having everything work right.</p>

      <div class="twelve columns" class="centre">
<p>Especially for builds not using Kajiit passive bonuses, or nightblade quick invis. skill, slotting the right champion points into speed and stealth is extremely important, combined with the right gear - you will be virtually invisible while standing next to or in-front of almost any NPC!</p>
        <hr>
<p>Alright! so for my build, I went with the trifecta of stealth detection reducers.
To accomplish this, I have utilized several set bonuses: from <i class="gold2">Vesture of Darloc Brae</i> some <i class="gold2">Night Mother's Embrace</i> and<i style="color:gold;"> Night Terror</i>. The main idea is to stack the stealth detection effects as much as possible with these three sets, it doesn't matter which piece is in which slot.</p>

<p><i class="gold2">Night Terror</i> is (<i class="green">3 items</i>) Reduces the radius you can be detected while Sneaking by 2 meters. Reduces the cost of Sneak by 10%. <br />
<i class="gold2">Vesture of Darloc Brae</i> is (<i class="green">4 items</i>) Reduces the radius you can be detected while Sneaking by 2 meters. Reduces the cost of Sneak by 10%. <br /> as well as adding Magicka and Stamina Recovery (which is very important for this build as well). <br />
<i class="gold2">Night Mother's Embrace</i> is (<i class="green">5 items</i>) Reduces the radius you can be detected while Sneaking by 2 meters. Reduces the cost of Sneak by 25%.<br >
On top of the extra stamina recovery from less pieces!</p>
        <hr>
Of course, feel free to fit whatever piece in whatever slot, as long as you can fill the armor set requirements! 
The locations for the sets are as follows:<br />
<i class="gold2">Night Mother's Embrace</i> : can be found overland in Deshaan<br />

<i class="gold2">Vesture of Darloc Brae</i> : can be found overland in Elsweyr<br />

<i class="gold2">Night Terror</i> : can be found overland in Stormhaven<br /> 
<br />

<i class="green">Overworld Pickups are all the same:</i> - Delve Bosses <i class="blue">(waist or feet)</i>, World Bosses <i class="blue">(head, chest, legs, weapon)</i>, Public Dungeon <i class="blue">(shoulders, hand, or weapon)</i>, Dolemn Chests <i class="blue">(ring or necklace)</i> and Treasure Chest and Psijic Portals

  <p> 
For this build, I am pushing for the maximum reduction of detection range as well as increasing magicka regeneration and speed. There are different options depending on what class your character is, and if you are vampire or not but for my setup this is what I have:
<br />
From the <i class="green">Crafting Line</i>, The most importatnt to me is <i class="green">Out of Sight</i> and <i class="green">Fleet Phantom</i> as well as <i class="green">Sustaning Shadows</i>. If you have the points avalible, <i class="green">Rationer</i> is a good choice, but I have opted for max gold output, so I have <i class="green">Cutpurse's Art</i> and <i class="green">Fortune's Favor</i>.</p>

       <img src="./images/mchamppoints.png" width="70%" />
      </div>

    <div class="seven columns"><p>
From the <i class="blue">Warfare Line</i>, I have chosen <i class="blue">Arcane Supremeacy</i> and <i class="blue">Endless Endurance</i>, as well as <i class="blue">Tireless Discipline</i>. These last two are very important if you do not choose to be a vampire. It might be a better idea to slot your points into increasing your weapon and spell damage if you are vampire, but extra stamina is always nice! <br />

Finally, from the <i class="red">Fitness line</i> I chose to get a speed boost with the <i class="orange">Hastey</i> buff and more importantly, <i class="red">Rejuvenation</i> to keep your magicka and stamina recovery up as much as possible, the Vampire passive will help with keeping stamina but Magicka is also vital for using the shadow cloak ability.

</p>
<br />

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="twelve columns" class="centre">
<p>Champion points will help give you a good boost for your detection, with them and your gear setup, you will have effectivly -9 meter detection range! <br /> <br />
While being a vampire, most of the extra stamina regeneration is not as neccesary, it is definitely a must have if you don't want to go the vampire route. Though, if you do choose vampire, it will free up some resources to boost your Magicka (which is extremely useful as a nightblade with the shadowy disguise ability).</p>

<p> Now it's time to spill the beans! I have one major trick that helps me accomplish insane manouverability and quick movement, and that is the use of a <b class="orange">Gamepad/Controller</b>. Your milage may vary, but I find that using a controller when thieving gives me a massave advantage vs. keyboard/mouse - which I will explain shortly, but in either case, The main objective when thieving is moving from target to target with speed and without interruptions. <br /> <br />
Alignment of your character is the name of the game, positioning yourself behind the npc, facing their back, and getting in and out of that position with speed. I have noticed an interesting mechanic/behavior: if you are caught pickpocketing and do not move away fast enough, you will break sneak mode and remain detected and become detected much easier than if you are able to move away immediately once you've been caught. If you move away fast enough, you will not break sneak mode, and will drop detection almost immediately. I have also noticed that npc's line of sight plays a huge role in breaking detection, especially when caught by a guard. - so practice being attentive to when you hear the sound that plays when you are caught, and being able to quickly move away, casting shadowy disguise as you go, and be as aware of your surroundings as much possible to be able to break line of sight.
  <br /> <br />
I find when thieving solo the most efficient method is - pick, pick, blade of woe - or pick once if there is multiple npc's in a small area, then blade of woe. The concept is that you can quickly move and steal from each target once, loop back and blade of woe them, then clean up and move on - allowing the npc's to re-spawn and refill their loot.  </p>

        <div class="seven columns">
<p> With a Controller, you are able to maneuver and position yourself behind npc's <i>without facing your camera the direction your character is facing</i> which is not possible with keyboard/mouse, which I believe gives me the biggest advantage. With a mouse it takes time and precise movement to turn your character around, but with a controller you just have to make them face the correct direction, which is much easier and quicker to me. Do note, that if your weapons are out (from blade of woe or casting some abilities) for some reason your character will appear to face the right direction, but will not activate targeting the opposite way your camera is positioned! <br />
<br />
If you don't have a controller, just practice getting the positioning and movement down after you have kitted out with the correct gear sets, champion points, and abilities. It takes time to get it down, but the more you practice thieving the easier it will become, and I have a few tips on where to do your thieving and add-ons as well, coming up!</p>

<p> Here I would like to point out a few super useful add-ons, if you aren't aware how to install add-ons feel free to message me on discord and I can help out! I will also have a link to all of the add-ons I use in general here. (at some point)</p>
<p>First and foremost: <b class="gold">Sneak Thief</b> is an excellent add-on that provides some UI enhancements, like changing reticle color when looting and indicating how many times an npc has been looted. <br />
<b style="color:goldenrod;">TheShining</b> is totally optional, but I really like how it allows you to change the brightness of AOE's, specifically when a guard casts their AOE stealth breaker. <br /> </p>
<p> <b style="color:goldenrod;">Dustman</b> is one of my favorite mods, and can be set up to automatically destroy items under a certain value or rarity. I personally have it configured to auto-destroy any <i class="green">Green</i> rarity items worth 100 gold or less aside from furnishing patterns and recopies. You can also set it up to auto-launder items as well!
        </div>
        <div class="five columns">
<img src="./images/addons1.png" > <br />
<p class="centre"> Dustman can help clear up your inventory so you can focus on thieving and collecting good loot! <br /> <i class="coral">
Be careful how much stuff you collect though! Sometimes guards can one-shot you with an unavoidable long-range shot. I typically will go until I get a bounty sheet or purple item or two, then go to the fence and launder everything.</i></p>

      </div>
 
      <div class="row">
        <div class="five columns">
<img src="./images/map.png" width="100%"> <br />
<p class="centre">Don't forget to launder <i class="gold">Bounty Sheets</i> and <i style="color:slategrey;">Polished Shillings</i>, and put them up on the guild store. I tend to sell mine for just a little under average price, or even low end TTC suggested. (If you have questions feel free to message me on discord)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="seven columns"> <p class="centre">
Some of my personal favorite places to thief, are #1 : <b class="gold">Vvardenfell</b>. <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Vivvec City</i> around the cantons and with easy access to the outlaws refuge, this is by far the best. The style pages are rare and worth a lot, and in my experience the guards drop a lot of Bounty Sheets that are usually worth a decent amount for the guild store! <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Sadrith Mora</i>, to the east, is also really good for stealing from guards. Personally, I also really enjoy <i>Balmora</i>, just north of <i>Seyda Neen</i>. <br />
 <i class="purple">Bangkorai</i> has a few excellent locations as well: <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Hallin's Stand</i> is a quest-locked town, that when complete offers a ton of guards, safeboxes, and tones of NPC's ripe with valuables fresh for the picking! :3 <br /> <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Evermore</i> is an expansive town filled with NPC's as well. <br />I also frequent <i class="underline">Mournhold</i> in <i class="green">Deshann</i>, <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Daggerfall</i> in <i style="color:darkseagreen;">Glenumbra</i>, and <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Alinor</i> in <i style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">Summerset</i>.</p>
